# 🧪 Python Practice Projects  
A growing collection of small, focused Python scripts created as I learn, experiment, and build confidence as a developer. Each project is simple, self‑contained, and designed to help me practice core programming concepts while having fun along the way.

## 🎯 Purpose  
This repository is my personal sandbox — a place to:

- Explore Python fundamentals  
- Practice problem‑solving through small, real‑world tasks  
- Build muscle memory with Git and GitHub  
- Track my progress as I grow into a full‑stack developer  

Every file in this repo represents a step forward — honest, experimental, and full of learning.

## 📂 Current Projects

### **🍕 pizza_splitter.py**
A small restaurant bill helper. It prints a shared menu, shows what each person ordered by name, calculates the total cost of each person’s order, then splits the combined bill evenly between three people. It’s great for practicing dictionaries, lists, `sum()`, `join()`, and basic arithmetic with rounding.

## 🌱 What’s Coming Next
As I continue learning, I’ll keep adding new mini‑projects — anything from calculators to text‑based games to small utilities that solve everyday problems.
Maybe the projects themselves will grow and change. 

This repo is meant to grow with me.

## 💡 About Me
I’m a student at Maestro College studying for my Associates in Applied Sciences in AI Engineering. I love building things that feel intentional, organized, and a little playful — and this repo is my space to practice freely and document my journey.
